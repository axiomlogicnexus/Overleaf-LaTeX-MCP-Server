I'll examine your current codebase to understand the existing structure and provide targeted feedback on your Overleaf LaTeX MCP Server plan.

Based on my analysis of your existing codebase and the plans you've outlined, I can provide targeted feedback on your Overleaf LaTeX MCP Server project. You have a solid foundation with both Python and TypeScript implementations already in progress.

Current State Assessment

Strengths of your existing implementation:

You have working Python (FastMCP) and TypeScript (Node.js) implementations

Good separation of concerns with modular tool organization

Proper MCP protocol implementation with WebSocket support

LaTeX parsing capabilities with TexSoup

Basic compilation and document management tools

Critical gaps and recommendations:

1. Git Integration Architecture

Your current TypeScript implementation has basic Git operations, but lacks the robustness needed for production:

// Current approach is too simplistic

const client = new OverleafGitClient(gitToken, projectId);

Recommendation:

Implement a Git provider abstraction with:

Conflict resolution strategies (fast-forward-only, rebase, branch-per-session)

Credential management with multiple auth methods

Large file/LFS detection and handling

Atomic operations with rollback capability

2. Compilation Provider Strategy

Your Python implementation only supports local compilation. You need:

Add this abstraction

class CompileProvider:

async def compile(self, resources, options): pass

class CLSIProvider(CompileProvider):

# CLSI backend implementation

class LocalProvider(CompileProvider):

# Local latexmk implementation

3. Missing Critical Tools

Your current tool set lacks several essential capabilities from your research:

High-priority additions:

patch_text_file_contents

with hash-based validation (from mcp-text-editor pattern)

tex_preflight

with chktex/latexindent integration

analyze_structure

using latex-utensils for AST parsing

git_commit_patch

with conflict detection

Async compilation with operation tracking

4. Security and Sandboxing

Neither implementation addresses security concerns:

Critical needs:

Sandbox local LaTeX compilation (container or restricted user)

Path traversal protection

Shell-escape policy enforcement

Resource size limits and timeouts

Credential masking in logs

5. Error Handling and Observability

Your current error handling is basic. You need:

Add structured error taxonomy

class LaTeXError(Exception):

def init

(self, error_type, file_path, line_number, message):

self.error_type = error_type  # 'syntax', 'missing_file', 'package'

self.file_path = file_path

self.line_number = line_number

self.message = message

6. Artifact Management

Both implementations embed content directly in responses. For production:

// Instead of base64 embedding

return { pdf_content: base64_pdf };

// Use temporary URLs

return {

pdf_url: await artifactStore.createTempUrl(pdf_buffer, '1h'),

expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000)

};

Architectural Recommendations

Choose TypeScript as Primary

Based on your research and current progress, stick with TypeScript for the main server:

Better MCP SDK support

Stronger ecosystem for HTTP/WebSocket handling

Good Git tooling with system git CLI wrapper

Add Python sidecar only for LaTeX-specific tools (chktex, latexindent)

Tool Organization Strategy

Restructure your tools into logical groups:

// Core tools (always available)

compile_latex / compile_latex_async

get_compile_status / cancel_compile

git_clone_overleaf / git_pull_push

// LaTeX-specific tools (require LaTeX environment)

tex_preflight / tex_lint / tex_format

analyze_structure / get_sections

create_equation / create_table / create_figure

// Advanced tools (require additional setup)

cite_lookup (needs internet)

collaborate_merge (needs merge tools)

Configuration Management

Your projects.json approach is good but needs enhancement:

{

"projects": {

"default": {

"name": "My Thesis",

"projectId": "...",

"gitToken": "...",

"compileProvider": "clsi",

"policies": {

"shellEscape": "restricted",

"maxFileSize": "10MB",

"allowedExtensions": [".tex", ".bib", ".png", ".pdf"]

}

}

}

}

Implementation Priority

Phase 1 (Core stability):

1. Implement compile provider abstraction

2. Add proper Git conflict handling

3. Implement hash-based patch validation

4. Add structured error parsing

Phase 2 (LaTeX intelligence):

1. Integrate latex-utensils for AST parsing

2. Add preflight checks (chktex integration)

3. Implement smart section manipulation

4. Add bibliography tools

Phase 3 (Production readiness):

1. Add sandboxing and security policies

2. Implement artifact management with TTL

3. Add comprehensive observability

4. Performance optimization and caching

Specific Code Improvements

Your current document_tools.py

has good structure but needs:

Add validation and conflict detection

@mcp.tool()

def save_document(content: str, file_path: str, expected_hash: Optional[str] = None) -> str:

if expected_hash:

current_content = Path(file_path).read_text() if Path(file_path).exists() else ""

if hashlib.sha256(current_content.encode()).hexdigest() != expected_hash:

raise ConflictError("File has been modified by another process")

# Validate LaTeX before saving

try:

doc = LaTeXDocument(content=content)

doc.validate()  # Add this method

except LaTeXSyntaxError as e:

return f"Validation failed: {e}"

Your plan is solid and well-researched. The main improvements needed are in robustness, security, and production-readiness rather than fundamental architecture changes. Focus on the Phase 1 priorities first to create a stable foundation.
