Your feedback from the five different sources is comprehensive and aligned with best practices for building a robust, secure, and efficient Overleaf LaTeX MCP Server. The strengths of your strategic choice in using TypeScript, leveraging a Python sidecar for specific LaTeX tooling, and segmenting concerns between CLSI and Git operations are validated throughout. Here’s an integrated view, consolidating all feedback into a cohesive action plan:

Quick Review of Your Current Structure:

Language Standard

: TypeScript is recommended as the primary language due to its strengths in asynchrony, MCP SDK support, and excellent tooling for both HTTP/WebSocket communications and Git operations.

Python Sidecar

: A good choice for leveraging existing LaTeX tooling like chktex and latexindent.

Tool Separation

: Clearly defining tools around core (compilation, Git interactions) and LaTeX-specific (parsing, formatting) functions provides clarity and modularity.

Key Focus Areas:

1. Complete Documentation

:

ARCHITECTURE.md

: Include system diagrams, data-flow, and responsibility charts to clarify infrastructure dependencies.

API.md

: Provide detailed endpoint definitions, payload schemas, supported HTTP methods, and anticipated status codes.

ROADMAP.md

: Define distinct phases with clear milestones (v0.1 -> v1.0 with specific features/goals like async support, security hardening).

2. Compile Provider Abstraction

:

Implement a CompileProvider

interface with both CLSI and Local implementations.

The LocalProvider

must adhere to sandbox constraints, enforce resource and escape limits, and use subprocess child management policies outlined in your global_rules.md.

3. Job Queue and Rate Limiting

:

Establish an efficient, durable queue system to manage compile job requests (e.g., BullMQ) & implement coalescing to prevent redundant jobs.

Provide queue status APIs for client visibility and implement rate limiting policies to safeguard server resources.

4. Secure and Structured Git Operations

:

Operate Git interactions on session/topic branches, ensuring a non-destructive flow.

Implement hash-validated patches and enforce branch-per-session workflows to maintain collaborative integrity and prevent override.

5. Artifact Management and Output Handling

:

Implement an ArtifactStore

for managing compile outputs without embedding them (avoid base64).

Use ephemeral URLs for client-side retrieval of large files, with proper TTL management to minimize storage load.

6. Security and Compliance

:

Strengthen path, session, and environment sanitization, especially when handling user data and interaction.

Enforce config-driven security policies at project-level (shell-escape, resource sizes, access).

Mask all secrets and maintain a clean log and tracing setup to avoid breaches.

7. Observability and Diagnostic Enhancements

:

Adopt structured logging with pino, coupled with Prometheus metrics for real-time monitoring.

Enrich diagnostics by parsing return logs into structured JSON responses that include problem context (file, line, error type).

8. Development Automation

:

Create scripts/tools for automated API documentation generation to ensure easy maintenance and consistent reflection of codebase changes.

Leverage CI/CD pipelines to enforce conventional commit standards and automate CHANGELOG updates.

9. Phased Development Plan

:

Initial focus on system stability with a single compile provider and basic queue.

Incrementally build features like async operations, comprehensive error handling, real-time metrics, and enhanced Git workflows leading to production readiness.

Emphasize testing and secure deployment practices at each stage to catch issues early.

Recap:

Your skeleton architecture is robust, but to evolve into a production-grade platform, prioritize continuous improvement and clear documentation. By framing a structured timeline around these key areas and keeping iterative testing central to your progress, you’ll significantly minimize risk while maximizing adaptability to complex workflows and future enhancements.
