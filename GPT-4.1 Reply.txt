Your design direction is correct and well-substantiated by the reviews you’ve gathered. The essentials—modular tool registration, compile provider abstraction, reliable and secure Git handling, strong policy enforcement, and clear separation of concerns—are all recognized as industry best practice and covered in the collective feedback. Here’s a synthesis and prioritized complaint/checklist:

1. Documentation gaps must be filled now

• ARCHITECTURE.md, API.md, and ROADMAP.md are currently empty.

• Without clear diagrams, endpoint schemas, and roadmap milestones, development will drift and security/ops concerns might get missed.

• Action: draft your component diagram, tool schemas, and phased delivery timeline before fleshing out more business logic.

2. Compile/job abstraction is non-negotiable

• Implement a CompileProvider interface (with both CLSIProvider and LocalProvider).

• The LocalProvider must sandbox execution and fully obey global_rules.md—no shell-escape, strong workspace root containment, child-process spawning with args arrays only, strict timeout/kills, and resource limits.

• Do not bake Overleaf-specific logic into tool handlers; always indirect via the abstraction.

3. Job queue, debouncing, and workspace lifecycle

• Add a persistent/debounced compile queue that can collapse rapid-fire requests and avoid duplicate brewing.

• Rate-limit and provide an API/method for clients to see queue status (queue depth, per-project lag).

• Clean up temp workspaces on TTL expiry or session close to avoid disk bloat.

4. Git workflows need hardening

• Always operate on a per-session/topic branch (never main directly).

• All changes are applied as hash-validated, patch-based, line-focused commits.

• Merge into main should be user-triggered (never forced by LLM/automation alone).

• Pre-merge checks: main.tex present, no large binaries, conventional commit messages.

5. Security rails and policy enforcement

• Make path normalization and root verification a helper called everywhere a user path is consumed.

• Don’t allow shell: true in any subprocess invocation.

• Enforce limits and verify project policies are respected at the provider/tool level, not just at the boundary.

• Secrets must never leak into logs/metrics.

6. Error handling, diagnostics, and observability

• All tools should return structured {status, data, errors[]} objects, not strings.

• Log artifacts and diagnostics must be parsed—never just stream raw .log back to the client.

• Add JSON logging + Prometheus metrics (compile times, queue stats, operationId tracing) EARLY to catch issues before scale.

7. Output/artifact handling

• No more base64 returns for PDF/logs. Save output to a temp/object store; send short-lived secure URLs for clients to fetch.

• Systematic cleanup by TTL filter/batch.

8. Automation and doc updates

• Automate API documentation from current tool surface/schemas: dev_generate_api_docs must run on every significant change.

• Conventional commits and automated changelog generation keep developer hygiene high.

9. Phased implementation to mitigate delivery risk

• Phase 0.1: stand up queue and one compile provider, no async/jobs.

• 0.2: real queue, CLSI provider, begin ops/metrics plumbing.

• 0.3: session-based git, patching, branch/merge refinement, artifact store.

• 1.0: full audit, sandboxing reviewed, test matrix, documentation and SLA.

Summary:

The meta-feedback is unanimous. Your skeleton is strong, but production readiness depends on tightening workspace/compile abstractions, native security, robust queue/artifact management, and habitually updating documentation and ops surfaces. Do these first—then (re)implement advanced tools like AI-aware refactoring and output parsing on a foundation you can trust.
