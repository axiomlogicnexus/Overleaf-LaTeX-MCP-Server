High-level assessment: your plan is solid and pragmatic. TypeScript for the core MCP server, a potential Python sidecar for LaTeX tools, and the split between CLSI- and Git-oriented tools are the right calls. Below are targeted additions, potential pitfalls, and concrete refinements to strengthen reliability, usability, and security.

Architecture and execution model

Compile provider abstraction: don’t assume CLSI will be available or stable across deployments. Define a compile provider interface and ship at least two implementations:

CLSI-backed compile

Local compile (latexmk/xelatex) with sandboxing (container or job user) and a package cache

This lets you switch seamlessly per project or environment.

Job queue and coalescing: throttle concurrent compiles and coalesce successive edits to avoid redundant builds. Introduce a per-project debounce window and a global compile queue with priorities.

Storage isolation: isolate working directories per project/session; sanitize paths and block symlinks escaping the workspace. Implement artifact TTL and periodic cleanup.

Artifact delivery: for large files (PDF), avoid embedding base64 in responses. Provide short-lived URLs backed by a simple object store (local disk with an HTTP server, S3-compatible, or presigned links).

Git operations

Prefer system git over nodegit/isomorphic-git: the CLI is more robust and better-tested, especially for auth and merges. Keep a thin wrapper and parse errors. Fall back to libs only if the environment forbids subprocesses.

Auth handling: support:

Overleaf Cloud tokens (username/token or PAT)

Server Pro/SSO variations

Offer credential helpers and explicitly document where secrets are stored. Never log tokens; mask them in traces.

Conflict strategy: provide modes:

fast-forward-only (fail if divergence)

rebase with ours/theirs bias

branch-per-session (recommended for LLM edits to avoid stomping collaborators)

Return a structured merge report to the client.

Large files/LFS: Overleaf often has limitations around LFS. Proactively detect large/binary commits and block or warn with policy.

Compilation and diagnostics

Structured error taxonomy: parse .log into structured diagnostics (error/warn/info, file, line, code). Normalize CLSI vs local output into one schema.

Streaming logs: expose incremental log streaming for long builds, not only final artifacts. This improves LLM feedback loops.

Preflight checks: ship chktex, latexindent, and a fast bespoke validator (for graphics paths, missing figures/bibs, unescaped underscores, etc.). Make these MCP tools first-class:

tex_preflight (already planned)

tex_format (latexindent) with dry-run mode and diff output

tex_lint (chktex) with rule configuration

Shell-escape and security policy: per-project policy for shell-escape, network access, and writeable dirs. Surface violations early with actionable messages.

LaTeX parsing and intelligent editing

Use latex-utensils (TypeScript) for parsing and outlines. It gives AST for sections, labels, citations, environments, useful for:

analyze_structure / tex_outline

delete_section, insert_paragraph, edit_file_line with AST-aware ranges

Cross-references and bibliography:

Tools: cite_lookup (DOI/arXiv/URL → BibTeX via Crossref/ads), check_refs (undefined/unused labels/citations), bib_resolve (as you noted).

Safer patching: adopt a diff+hash format like mcp-text-editor’s patch protocol to prevent drift. Always round-trip through validation (file hash and hunk context) to avoid destructive edits.

MCP tool design and versioning

Stable schemas and versioning: namespace your tools (e.g., overleaf.compile.v1). Add a get_capabilities tool that returns feature flags (CLSI available, shell-escape allowed, async compile supported).

Long-running tasks: standardize async patterns:

Every async tool returns an operationId, with get_operation_status and cancel_operation. Also emit server-sent events where supported.

Limits and chunking: enforce max payload sizes and introduce chunked resource uploads or pre-upload references to avoid oversized MCP messages.

Observability and ops

Structured logs and metrics: use pino (JSON) and expose metrics (Prometheus) for:

compile latency/success, queue depth, cache hit rate, git sync outcomes, failures by category.

Tracing: OpenTelemetry spans for git, compile, patch apply, and artifact upload. Correlate by project_id and operationId.

Idempotency and retries: idempotency keys for compile and patch operations; exponential backoff with jitter for Git and CLSI calls. Classify retryable vs terminal errors.

Health checks: readiness probes should assert external dependencies (git reachable, CLSI reachable or local toolchain available).

Security and policy

Secrets management: load via env/secret store; validate on boot; never write secrets to logs. Provide a project-level credential store abstraction.

Policy enforcement: pre-receive emulation to block disallowed files, enforce main.tex presence, reject large binaries, enforce line-ending policy, and optionally auto-run format/lint before accept.

Sandbox local compiles: run latexmk under a restricted user or container with network off by default; whitelist graphics/include paths.

Developer experience and testing

Representative fixtures: include a suite of sample projects (basic article, beamer, thesis, heavy biblatex/biber, minted/shell-escape, TikZ-heavy).

Golden tests:

Preflight: deterministic log snapshots

Compile: assert warnings/error classes rather than binary PDF bytes (which are nondeterministic)

Git flows: simulate conflict scenarios with scripted repos

Dry-run modes: for risky actions (delete_section, auto_format), return proposed diffs and a risk score before making changes.

Workflow enhancements

Session branches: create a branch per LLM session; push PR-style back to main upon user confirmation, with compiled artifact linked. Reduces surprise overwrites.

Compile-on-push with annotations: attach compile status and a link to the PDF/log to the git notes or commit metadata you return to clients.

Debounced compile-after-patch: allow the client to batch multiple edits and then trigger a compile explicitly or after a short idle timeout.

Windows-specific caveats (your current environment)

latexindent (Perl) and chktex availability on Windows need validation; consider a Dockerized toolchain or WSL. If not feasible, gate these tools and detect availability at runtime.

Ensure path normalization and encoding handling for TeX (UTF-8 defaults and BOM issues).

Concrete tool list refinement

Compile: compile_latex (sync), compile_latex_async, get_compile_status, get_compile_artifact

Git: git_clone_overleaf, git_pull_push, git_commit_patch (with patch validation), git_create_session_branch

Text/structure: tex_outline (latex-utensils), search_content, edit_file_line (hash-validated), delete_section, insert_paragraph

Quality: tex_preflight, tex_lint (chktex), tex_format (latexindent dry-run/apply), check_refs, bib_resolve, cite_lookup

Ops: get_capabilities, get_health, get_metrics, cancel_operation

Potential complaints or watch-outs

nodegit complexity and footprint; prefer system git.

Over-reliance on CLSI availability; mitigate with the compile provider abstraction.

Returning large base64 artifacts over MCP; prefer URLs with TTL.

LLM-driven whole-file rewrites; enforce patch-based workflows with conflict detection and guardrails.

Missing persistent policy layer; define per-project policies and enforce them early.

Insufficient concurrency control; add a queue and coalescing to keep compiles under control.

If you want next steps, I can provide a minimal TypeScript server skeleton with:

Tool registration for compile_latex(_async), git_commit_patch, tex_outline

A compile provider interface with a local latexmk implementation stub

Pino logging, Prometheus metrics, and OpenTelemetry wiring

A simple file-backed object store for artifact TTL URLs
